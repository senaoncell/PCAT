SERVER OPERATIONS

A firewall or antivirus software on your computer or network may be blocking access to the server. Check if such software is blocking access to the server.

Check the IP address of the server. If it is running on a specific IP address, not just localhost, try accessing it using that address.
Try "127.0.0.1:3000" instead of "localhost".

VERSION CHANGES

In version 8.5.2 of mongoose, "findByIdAndDelete" started to be used instead of "findByIdAndRemove".

After node js 16.0.0 version, "node:fs" and "node:path" started to be used.
